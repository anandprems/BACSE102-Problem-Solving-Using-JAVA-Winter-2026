## 🚀 Why This Course?

Programming is no longer limited to the Computer Science domain.  
Java plays a major role across multiple engineering fields:

- **CSE/IT** → Software development, backend apps, OOP, enterprise systems  
- **ECE/EEE** → IoT, embedded software, automation, device programming  
- **Mechanical** → Robotics, control systems, CAD automation, simulations  
- **Civil** → GIS tools, modelling systems, automation in construction workflows  
- **All Engineers** → Logical thinking, problem-solving, automation skills

## 📘 Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand and apply **Java fundamentals** and basic programming constructs  
- Implement **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** through classes, objects, inheritance & polymorphism  
- Work with **exception handling**, **multithreading**, and **file I/O streams**  
- Use **Collections Framework**, **Generics**, and **Lambda expressions**  
- Connect Java applications with **databases (JDBC)**  
- Develop clean, modular, and reusable software components
